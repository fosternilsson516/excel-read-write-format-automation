# Read Write Excel Test Case Automation

## Introduction
This project was developed specifically for Xcel Energy to assist in automating the creation of test scripts for quality assurance processes. Originally, the requirement gathering for each test case involved a manual method where inputs were created and used as a basis for crafting the actual test scripts that were to be executed. This process was cumbersome and involved a lot of repetitive copying and pasting.

## Solution
To streamline this process, I developed a Python script that automates the generation of these test scripts. While this automation script is tailored specifically to fit the process used in Xcel Energy's script creation workflow, it may require modifications to be adapted for use in different projects or environments.

## Deployment
An executable file was created using PyInstaller to simplify the distribution and execution of the script. This executable has been shared with team members to facilitate and expedite their script writing tasks, significantly reducing manual effort and enhancing productivity.

## Usage
Currently, the tool is designed for use within Xcel Energy and may require code adjustments to fit other specific requirements or environments. For those within the company, the executable can be run to automate the script generation process without needing a Python environment set up.

## Note
If there is interest in adapting this script for other projects or teams, further development and customization might be needed to suit different parameters or workflows.
