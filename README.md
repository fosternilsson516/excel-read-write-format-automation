At Xcel Energy, my recent task involved authoring test cases which subsequently served as the foundation for our Test Scripts. This process entailed substantial data duplication across two Excel files. To streamline this, I developed a Python script that not only automated the data transfer but also formatted the content into a new Excel sheet. To enhance user experience, I incorporated interactive prompts. Further, I consolidated the entire solution into a single executable file. Now, any team member at Xcel who completes their test cases can effortlessly use this tool to automate the creation of their test scripts.
